>How about building a simple music player?

I started this project since I finished the elemental classes of Android. I looked forward to doing some demos that would help enhance my understanding of Android.

This MusicPlayer is my first project.

Service, BroadcastReceiver, ContentProvider, Intent, and of course, Activity will be used in this project, and these five are the most important point in Android development.
